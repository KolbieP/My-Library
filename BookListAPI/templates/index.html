                        <h4>R.F. Kuang</h4>
                        <p>An epic historical military fantasy, inspired by the bloody history of China’s twentieth
                            century and filled with treachery and magic.
                            <br><br>It follows Rin, a war orphan who shocks everyone by acing the Empire-wide test and getting into the elite military school, Sinegard. Despite facing discrimination, Rin discovers her aptitude for shamanism and learns to control her powers with the help of a seemingly insane teacher.
                            <br><br>As the threat of a Third Poppy War looms, Rin’s shamanic powers may be the only way to save her people. But as she finds out
                            more about the god that has chosen her, the vengeful Phoenix, she fears that winning the war
                            may cost her humanity . . . and that it may already be too late.

                        <h4>Matt Haig</h4>
                        <p>When Nora Seed finds herself in the Midnight Library, she has a chance to make things right.
                            Up until now, her life has been full of misery and regret. She feels she has let everyone
                            down, including herself. But things are about to change.
                            <br><br>The books in the Midnight Library enable Nora to live as if she had done things
                            differently. With the help of an old friend, she can now undo every one of her regrets as
                            she tries to work out her perfect life. But things aren't always what she imagined they'd
                            be, and soon her choices place the library and herself in extreme danger.
                            <br><br>Before time runs out, she must answer the ultimate question: what is the best way to
                            live?

                        <h3>Circe</h3>
                        <h4>Madeline Miller</h4>
                        <p>In the house of Helios, god of the sun and mightiest of the Titans, a daughter is born. But
                            Circe is a strange child--neither powerful like her father nor viciously alluring like her
                            mother. Turning to the world of mortals for companionship, she discovers that she does
                            possess power: the power of witchcraft, which can transform rivals into monsters and menace
                            the gods themselves.
                            <br><br>Threatened, Zeus banishes her to a deserted island, where she hones her occult
                            craft, tames wild beasts, and crosses paths with many of the most famous figures in all of
                            mythology, including the Minotaur, Daedalus and his doomed son Icarus, the murderous Medea,
                            and, of course, wily Odysseus.
                            <br><br>But there is danger, too, for a woman who stands alone, and Circe unwittingly draws
                            the wrath of both men and gods, ultimately finding herself pitted against one of the most
                            terrifying and vengeful of the Olympians. To protect what she loves most, Circe must summon
                            all her strength and choose, once and for all, whether she belongs with the gods she is born
                            from or with the mortals she has come to love.
